\problem{1}
We refer to it as linear because it is a straight line. It measures the strength of the \textit{linear} association between two variables.


\problem{2}
No, we cannot conclude that gaining weight is a cause of increased blood pressure because \textit{correlation does not imply causation}.


\problem{3}
A scatterplot is a plot of paired (x,y) quantitative data with a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis. It helps us to visually determine whether there is a correlation between two variables.

  \caption{Brain Volume and IQ}
\end{figure}

There does not appear to be any correlation between brain density and IQ.\

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{assets/heights-of-fathers-and-sons.png}
  \caption{Heights of Fathers and Sons}
\end{figure}

There does not appear to be any correlation between the heights of fathers and their first born sons.


\problem{9}
$r = 0.127$ and the critical value of $r$ with 5 data points is 0.878. Therefore there \textit{is not a linear correlation} between brain volume and IQ.\


\problem{10}
$r = 0.980$ and the critical value of $r$ with 7 data points is 0.754. Therefore there \textit{is a linear correlation} between chest sizes and weights in anesthetized bears.


\problem{11}
$r = -0.987$ and the critical value of $r$ with 7 data points is 0.754. Therefore there \textit{is a linear correlation} between car weight and fuel consumption.


\problem{12}
$r = -0.017$ and the critical value of $r$ with 10 data points is 0.632. Therefore there \textit{is not a linear correlation} between the heights of fathers and their first born sons.
